    "**How are American news headline sentiments correlated to their publication source's political leanings?** To do this, we wanted three sources that reflected 'far-left', 'centrist', and 'far-right' political leanings. Using both AllSides and MediaBiasFactCheck, Breitbart was evaluated as the most right-leaning news source of our dataset, CNN was evaluated as the most left-leaning news source, and NPR was evaluated as the most politically-centrist news source [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. *We hypothesize that the two more politically polar news sources, Breitbart and CNN, will have more polar sentiment (as in frequently positive or negative-- bimodal distribution), and the more centrist news source, NPR, will be more neutral in sentiment.*\n",

The dataset includes factors such as the title of the article, the publication source, the author, and date published. The dataset is split into three csvs; we felt that as this dataset was so huge, and we are not planning on using it in its entirety, we did not need another dataset."

    "The data is fairly clean to begin with, there are few missing values and the format is consistent throughout. The issue we have is there is a lot of data that we do not need to use. So, to get our data into a useable format, we will only select the three publications we plan to use, Breitbart, CNN, and NPR, and keep the dates and headlines from only 1,000 of each. We decided on 1,000 of each because the dataset had a higher number of Breitbart articles than any other publication, and we wanted there to be a standard number of headlines for each source. Given that we plan on doing the additional step of sentiment analysis after this data checkpoint, most of our EDA will come next week, and so data distribution checking or data transformations will not be necessary at this time. It is also possible that as this project proceeds, we may decide to add in more points of data analysis, such as increasing how many articles we analyze from each news source, or even adding in different news sources to give us data for a 'center-right' and 'center-left source', if we feel that would improve the strength of our project."
