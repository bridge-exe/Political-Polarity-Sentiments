For our final project, we decided to observe news sources and their headlines to measure the sentiment and see whether more political sources tend to have more polar sentiment. 
To do this, we picked three news publications from three different parts of the political spectrum, CNN, Breitbart, and NPR. 
We found that our initial hypothesis, that the two more politcally polar sources, CNN and Breitbart, would be more polar in sentiment, and that NPR would be more neutral, was correct.
